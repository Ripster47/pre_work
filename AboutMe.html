  <h3 style="color:#33ff00">A little bit about where I come from, where I'm going, and how I plan to get there!</h3>
  <hr>

  <p style="color:#33ff00">I grew up in the northwest suburbs of Chicago and have lived there my whole life. I currently live with my girlfriend Alanna of 4 years about 9 minuted from the house where I grew up. I aquired a Bachelors of Sciences degree in Zoology and tried my best to get a job in a zoo or aquarium. Unfortunately that wasnt working out so I ended up working at a scuba diving shop, learning how to dive, and then how to teach others to dive, but eventually found myself working at a school for children with emotional disorders. After 5 years of working there and loving it I decided to make a career change and go into computer coding.</p>
