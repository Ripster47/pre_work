    </h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Firstly, seperate your sesame seaweed bun and place the bottom half squarely in front of you at your freshly cleaned krabby patty konstruction station.(set aside the top bun for later use)</li>
    <li>Relocate to the grill, turn on the burners, and bring the surface to a sizzling 401.3 degrees (EXACTLY)</li>
    <li>Once surface is heated accordingly, place your krabby patty onto the grill using your official, krusty krab patented, hydro-dynamic spatula. </li>
    <li>Kook thouroughly on each side for exactly 2 minutes and 45 seconds to acheive perfect, browned, sizzling deliciousness! </li>
    <li>Once the patty is cooked perfectly, place onto the open and ready seasame seaweed bun</li>
    <li>Quickly lay pickles down onto patty, making a perfect smily face on each with your koral ketchup,</li> 
    <li>Read a quick bedtimes story to the pickles to make sure they are ready to be consumed, their preferences are "Goodnight Moon Jelly" or "The Very Hungry Sea Cucumber". (This is an important technique to kreate a flavor that even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taD2YOx47fQ">King Neptune</a> himself will want to try a second time!)</li>
    <li>Tuck the pickles in with a slice of undersea cheese laid over the top of them</li>
    <li>Place a moderate slice of marine tomato atop the cheese and make a large smiley face on it using the stonefish ground mustard.</li>
    <li>Top the patty with a leaf of fresh deep sea lettuce, a thick slice of sandbar onion, and barnacle shavings to garnish</li>
    <li>Place the top of your seasame seweed bun atop your masterpice and viola! Congratulations on kreating your first ever krabby patty!</li>
